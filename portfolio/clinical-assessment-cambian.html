      <h1>Accurate data collection leads to improved outcomes for special-needs children</h1>
      <h2>The Client</h2>
      <p>
        Cambian Group is one of the UK's leading children's specialist education and behavioural health service providers. Founded in 2004, it has grown to become a significant partner to the UK public sector. The Group's services have a specific focus on children who present high severity needs with challenging behaviours and complex care requirements. Cambian looks after 2,100 children and employs over 4,000 people across a portfolio of 224 residential facilities, specialist schools and fostering offices located in England and Wales.
      </p>
      <h2>The Requirement</h2>
      <p>
        Cambian employs a unique holistic model of measuring the progress of individuals in its care – the Global Assessment of Progress (GAP), encompassing regular, detailed assessments from different members of the multi-disciplinary team: teaching staff, occupational therapy, psychology, speech and language therapy etc. This paper-based process required a great deal of manual admin to collate and calculate the final scores. I was tasked with automating the process by providing an easy-to-use interface for the clinicians to input their findings and then collating the evidence into coherent reports that could be accessed anywhere. 
      </p>
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        A great part of the success of this project came down to a focus on usability: early user-interface mockups were tested with end-users and iterated until the input screens had evolved to become as clear and easy to use as they could be for busy teachers and clinicians in the distracting environment of a special-education setting, allowing them to input data on a variety of devices, when and where it suited them. Early trials impressed managers so much that they asked for the system to be adapted to be used in a range of different clinical settings outside of the original educational services; this resulted in a flexible, modular software architecture which made it much easier to expand the system’s capabilities in the future. While developing the prototypes, the value of the data being collected was recognized across the business and this in turn led to the creation of a centralized data-warehouse able to produce management reports linking clinical outcomes with all manner of other financial and operational data.
      </p>
      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        Feedback from the product roll-out showed that teaching and clinical staff were delighted with the ease of use and speed with which they could input objective measurements of each child’s progress. Site managers and team heads were satisfied that comprehensive centralised reporting provided the ability to identify issues and suggest interventions in a timely manner. Funding bodies and parents were able to see visible measures of their children’s success and clear correlations between behavioural interventions and educational outcomes. The business as a whole was impressed by the vastly improved quality of data and joined-up reporting that took significantly fewer resources to produce.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool proved so successful within the Cambian Group’s Education division that it was quickly rolled out across all adult and children’s services – easily achieved thanks to the flexible approach taken in designing the software architecture. The company’s subsequent acquisition of Advanced Childcare Limited brought hundreds of new residential services into the group, all of which were easily transitioned to standardised data collection and reporting processes through the eGAP system. When Cambian’s adult mental health division was spun off into Cygnet Health Services, the proprietary software was considered to be a significant part of the organisation’s value and hence had a major impact on the price of acquisition.
