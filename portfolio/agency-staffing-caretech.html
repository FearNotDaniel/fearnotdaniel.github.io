      <h1>Ease of use and great design help a team to expand capacity while controlling costs</h1>
      <h2>The Client</h2>
      <p>
        The CareTech family of companies provide high quality care and support across the whole social care spectrum for children and adults below retirement age. Care and support solutions for adults and children are especially focussed on self-directed outcomes and outstanding value. For over 20 years, person centred support & care has been core to the values of Caretech. Their Personalisation Strategy describes their approach to Person centred care & support , bringing together every aspect of the organisation, putting the interests and needs of the individual at the heart of everything they do.
      </p>
      <h2>The Requirement</h2>
      <p>
        CareTech manages hundreds of facilities offering 24/7 care, all of which must be kept fully staffed at all times, including the option to deploy emergency staff at short notice in response to service user incidents. This requires the frequent use of agency workers, which is a challenge to manage cost-effectively when rates vary greatly between agencies according to location, shift type, and even day of the week or time of day. The ‘Flexi Team’ at CareTech required a solution that would streamline the request and deployment process of agency staff to facilities all over the UK, ensuring the highest quality staff could be placed into roles at the best available rates, with clear visibility across the whole organisation to ensure value for money was being achieved.
      </p>
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        Initial investigations centred on a buy-or-build decision, evaluating potential off-the-shelf solutions against a custom build on three factors: ability to adapt to the team’s specific needs, ease of use and total cost according to future projections. These were compared against a proposed bespoke solution, which caught the eye of the executive after recognizing that the team would be required to serve a greater volume and variety of services following acquisition of new subsidiaries. Interface prototypes of the proposed solution proved popular with both end users and managers, and it was found that compared with the volume-based pricing of existing applications, the long-term ROI of the custom solution would offer much better value to the business.
      </p>
      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        A clean task-based interface vastly improved the team’s ability to efficiently respond to requests while also controlling costs. Intelligent modelling of hundreds of agency rate cards and pricing rules allowed the system to recommend the first-choice agencies for every staffing request. Throughput was increased without needing to grow the team size, and management received timely and accurate reporting to ensure the cost of agency staff remained within budget. To ensure long-term maintenance of the system, one part of the consulting engagement was to recruit an in-house development team and complete a handover of both software architecture and product roadmap to ensure a smooth transition. The success of this project has laid the foundation for ongoing efficiency initiatives, such as a self-service staff request system for facility managers, integrating with agency’s own systems, and the capacity for the organisation to set up its own in-house “agency” of salaried bank staff, thus producing further cost savings with advanced data analysis providing a high degree of predictability in the area of supply and demand.
