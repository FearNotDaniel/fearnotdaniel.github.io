# Improving medication accuracy while saving costs

## The Client

Cambian Group is one of the UK's leading children's specialist education and behavioural health service providers. Founded in 2004, it has grown to become a significant partner to the UK public sector. The Group's services have a specific focus on children who present high severity needs with challenging behaviours and complex care requirements. Cambian looks after 2,100 children and employs over 4,000 people across a portfolio of 224 residential facilities, specialist schools and fostering offices located in England and Wales.

## The Requirement

Nursing staff in Cambianâ€™s adult hospitals are responsible for administering medications to thousands of patients every day. In addition to ensuring the correct scheduled doses are given, staff are also required to record emergency treatments given, and correctly re-order medicine stocks from the external pharmacy supplier. The traditional paper-based system imposed a great time burden on nursing staff, was easily susceptible to both dosing and recording errors, and was totally opaque to management reports without cumbersome manual data entry and compilation processes. In addition, since restocking orders were often missed, emergency orders often had to be placed with local pharmacies at an increased cost. The company sought to implement an innovative electronic system to overcome all these difficulties and provide greater reporting transparency.

## The Process

Cambian Group was aware that existing solutions existed for electronic medication recording; however in workshops with staff who had previously worked in NHS facilities it was found that these packages were considered very fiddly and difficult to use, which in turn actually reduced the accuracy of data collected as well as creating a greater burden of work for staff compared to the old paper systems. Instead a custom solution was proposed with a significant emphasis on modern, clean user interface design. Additionally, in the sometimes violent setting of a mental health ward, both information security and physical security were important requirements.

## The Result

Nursing staff were very pleased with the tablet-based system which integrated easily with their workflow while caring for patients. A hybrid web/native system ensured that all data was immediately synced to secure cloud servers instead of being kept on the device, which could be either carried around by staff or securely wall-mounted in staff-only dispensing areas. Low-cost commodity Android tablets were used so that in case of loss or damage another device could be immediately retrieved from standby. Doctors were easily able to amend prescriptions from their regular desktop/laptop systems which interfaced with the same centralized database. Electronic signatures created the ability to authorize emergency out-of-hours prescriptions from home, both increasing the turnaround time for treatments while also removing the requirement to travel to the premises. Management reporting and external integration provided much greater insights into both medication errors and improved cost control by ensuring automatic re-ordering from the approved supplier.
